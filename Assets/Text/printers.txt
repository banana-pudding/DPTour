3D Printing
The Factory can print 3D models for you for the low price of $1 per hour of print time. As long as the prints can fit in our printers and aren't any kind of weaponry or other prohibited items, we will happily help you fabricate and prototype your ideas. Please keep in mind that 3D printing is slower than most people assume, especially for larger or more detailed prints, and we handle a fairly large number of print requests, especially around senior design season, so please understand that we can only provide a 5 to 7 business day turn around from submission to pickup. Visit our space to learn how 3D printing works from one of our specialists!

Prepare your STL file
STL is a common format for the exchange of 3d models. Most modeling software should support this export format.
