Need a tool to use for your next project? We have a number of hand and electric tools, measuring and soldering equipment, data loggers, and probes, some of which can be borrowed and others which can only be used in-space. We also offer a collection of books for you to use as a reference in your project creation.

We offer various standard hand and electric tools to help you complete all your projects. Some tools are reserved for in-space use only. Most are provided as kits with varying sizes, attachments, etc.

We offer an assortment of easy-to-use data loggers and sensors that allow you to work at the cross section of science and technology. Pair these tools with our other electronics equipment and experiment with something new or borrow them for use in your own or coursework-related field studies.

Soldering kits are available for use in space by individuals who have completed a soldering safety session. We offer soldering workshops throughout the semester, and each workshop includes a safety session.
