Interested in developing for VR? We have an HTC Vive set up for you to use in the Factory at Discovery Park.

VIVE is a first-of-its-kind virtual reality platform developed by HTC and Valve for total immersion in virtual worlds. Using a headset and wireless controllers, you can now explore and interact with VR experiences, apps and games that blur the line between imagination and reality.

Our Vive is connected to a PC capable of playing games in Steam VR and developing for the Vive in many engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine.

You will need your own steam account to play VR games as the Factory does not purchase games or have an account.
